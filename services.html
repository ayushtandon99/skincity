                            <p>Acne is a common skin condition that occurs when hair follicles become clogged with oil and dead skin cells. It often presents as whiteheads, blackheads, pimples, or deeper cystic lesions, primarily on the face, chest, back, and shoulders. Acne is caused by hormonal changes, excess sebum production, bacterial infections, and inflammation. Stress, certain diets, and improper skincare can exacerbate the condition.</p>
                            <p>The visible effects of acne range from mild blemishes to painful nodules, often leaving scars or hyperpigmentation. Understanding your skin type and the root cause of acne is crucial for effective treatment, which may include topical medications, oral therapies, or advanced dermatological procedures.</p>

                            <p>Types of scars include hypertrophic scars, keloids, and atrophic scars, such as those caused by acne. These marks may appear raised, depressed, or discolored, and in some cases, they can cause itching or discomfort. Modern dermatology offers solutions to minimize scars, restoring smoother, even-toned skin.</p>

                            <p>Botox is a widely-used, non-surgical treatment designed to reduce the appearance of dynamic wrinkles caused by repeated facial expressions. Over time, movements like frowning, squinting, or smiling create lines such as crow’s feet, forehead wrinkles, and frown lines.</p>
                            <p>Botox works by temporarily relaxing the muscles that cause these wrinkles, resulting in smoother, more youthful-looking skin. It’s also used for medical conditions like excessive sweating and migraines. Safe and effective, Botox treatments offer visible results with minimal downtime, making it a popular choice for cosmetic enhancement.</p>

                            <p>Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune condition that accelerates the skin's cell turnover process, leading to thick, scaly patches on the skin. These lesions, often red and covered with silvery scales, can appear on the scalp, elbows, knees, or lower back.</p>
                            <p>The exact cause is unclear, but genetic predisposition and immune system triggers play a significant role. Factors like stress, infections, or weather changes can worsen the condition. Psoriasis is more than just a skin disorder—it can cause itching, burning, and emotional distress. Early diagnosis and management are key to controlling its impact.</p>

This condition occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks hair follicles, leading to hair thinning or bald spots on the scalp, face, or other parts of the body.</p>
                            <p>While the exact cause is not fully understood, genetics and environmental triggers like stress may contribute. Alopecia areata can have significant psychological effects, but various treatments aim to encourage hair regrowth and manage symptoms effectively.</p>
